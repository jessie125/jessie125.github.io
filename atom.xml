<p>A new way of financing public services gains momentum<br/>
一种公共服务融资方法取得很大发展</p>

<p>Feb 23rd 2013 |From the print edition</p>

<!--more-->


<p>AT HALF past six on a wet morning in central London, the city is already busy. Baristas are setting up inside coffee shops. Office cleaners are at work. And outreach teams from charities and local councils are on early-morning shifts to find rough sleepers and get them off the streets.</p>

<p>早上六点半，烟雨笼罩的伦敦市中心已开始熙熙攘攘，人们已忙碌起来。咖啡师在咖啡厅着手准备营业，办公室的清洁员打扫卫生，慈善外展队和市政委员会进行早班执勤，寻找露宿人员，并将其带离街道。</p>

<p>For most teams the priority is to find people who are newly homeless and help find them accommodation quickly, before they become settled in a pattern. Kath Sims, an outreach worker for a homelessness charity called St Mungo’s, is not looking for the new arrivals, however. She is trying to locate people in a specific group of 415 habitual rough sleepers, with the aim of prising them from the streets.</p>

<p>对于大多数外战队来说，最重要的是找到无家可归的人们，在他们习惯这种居无定所的生活模式之前，尽快帮助他们安顿下来。Kath Sims是（伦敦）无家可归者慈善组织“圣芒戈魔法”的一名外展工作者，她并没有寻找新的露宿者，而是试图找到415名当地习惯性露宿者形成的一个特殊群，让他们不再流浪街头。</p>

<p>That puts her at the front line of a big financial experiment, too. Her work is being funded by an instrument called a “social-impact bond” (SIB), which promises returns to private investors if social objectives are met. The bond raised £5m ($8m) from investors, to be shared between St Mungo’s and another organisation called Thames Reach (responsible for another 400-or-so homeless people).</p>

<p>这也使她站在一项大型金融试验的最前线，她所进行的工作得到了一家名为“社会效益债券”机构的赞助，该机构承诺，如果达到社会目标，个人投资者将会获得回报。这家债券机构从投资者融资5百万英镑（约8百万美元），为 “圣芒戈魔法”和另一家名为“泰晤士关爱”（负责400人左右的无家可归者）共享用。</p>

<p>The cash will fund a three-year programme, the success of which is measured by everything from the number of nights that the rough sleepers spend on the streets to their visits to hospital. As targets are met, payments will flow to investors from the Greater London Authority (GLA), the SIB’s commissioning body.</p>

<p>这些钱能资助一个为期3年的计划项目，其成功与否取决于露宿者晚上留宿街头的天数及去医院就诊的次数。如果达到预期的目标，“社会效益债券”机构的委托方即伦敦政府将会付款给投资者。</p>

<p>The arrangement suits all parties. The rough sleepers are frequent users of government services, including accident-and-emergency wards. Cutting their number should save the GLA enough money to fund payments to investors if goals are met. At a time when public spending is under pressure, the taxpayer stumps up only if results are achieved. Investors have the prospect of a return to entice them, of up to 6.5% if targets are met.</p>

<p>这一安排适用所有机构。露宿者是政府公共服务（包括事故急诊室）的“频繁用户”。如果达到目标，露宿者人数的减少是英国政府有足够的资金支付投资者。当公共支出面临不足之时，纳税人只要在目标实现的前提下进行纳税。投资者们有望得到收益回报来吸引纳税人的资金，如果目标实现的话，收益回报可能会高达6.5%。</p>

<p>As for organisations like St Mungo’s, they get upfront funding for a longer period than they would in a normal government contract. That matters. One of the people Ms Sims checks in on is a long-time rough sleeper with a history of violence, a drug habit to feed and a string of prison sentences. She needs time to build a relationship with him: stopping to say hello and roll him a cigarette is part of that process. Coaxing him into a hostel is not the right approach: he’d only end up in a fight and have an eviction on his record, which would make it much harder eventually to place him in permanent accommodation. The priority is to get his drug abuse under control by shifting him to methadone, at which point it becomes possible to think about accommodation. It all takes time.</p>

<p>对于如“圣芒戈魔法”的机构来说，相比一个正常的政府合同，他们获得前期资金的周期较长。这一点很重要。西姆女士探访了一位长期留宿街头的流浪者，他是一个有着暴力前科且多次服刑的吸毒人员。她需要时间和他建立一种关系：对其问好和为其卷烟是建立关系的一部分。哄劝他前往旅社不是一个权宜之策：这样会使他最终以打架的罪名而受到驱逐，从而更难为他安置到长期的住处。首先帮助他服用美沙酮，使他的毒品滥用得到控制，这样才有可能考虑安居的问题，这一过程需要时间。</p>

<p>The homelessness SIB is one of 14 that have now been issued or are in development in Britain, which pioneered the instrument back in 2010 with a bond funding a prisoner-rehabilitation programme in Peterborough. The idea is also winning fans elsewhere. New York city launched a SIB last year tackling recidivism among inmates at Rikers Island prison; Goldman Sachs is among the investors. Work is under way on three more American SIBs, one in New York state and two in Massachusetts. Jeffrey Liebman, a Harvard University professor who is providing technical assistance on all three, has just invited applications from other state and local governments to receive help setting up SIBs: 28 applied.</p>

<p>无家可归 “社会效益债券”现已发行或在英国得到发展，该债券早在2010年开创这一先河，即在（加拿大）彼得伯勒赞助一项“囚犯康复计划”。这一想法也获得世界各地人们的支持。纽约市在去年启动了“社会效益债券”计划，处理雷克岛监狱囚犯的再犯问题。高盛集团也在投资者之列。现已有另外三项美国“社会效益债券”工作正在进行中：一项位于纽约州，两项在马萨诸塞州。对这三项计划提供技术援助的哈佛大学教授杰弗里•利布曼邀请其他州和地方政府的申请接受建立“社会效益债券”机构：已有28个州和地方政府获得批准。</p>

<p>And there is rising emerging-market interest in SIBs, where they go under the name of “development-impact bonds”. According to Michael Belinsky of Instiglio, a start-up devoted to designing SIBs in poor countries, there is less scope for government savings to pay back investors in emerging markets because social safety nets are thinner. So international-development agencies are more likely to act as sponsors. Mr Belinsky is working on potential SIBs in India, to improve educational outcomes for girls in Rajasthan, and in Colombia, to reduce teenage-pregnancy and school drop-out rates.</p>

<p>“社会效益债券”以“发展影响债券”之名面向社会，有着不断上涨的新兴市场利率。致力于在贫穷国家建立“社会效益债券”的新兴公司Instiglio的迈克尔•别林斯基称：因为社会保障体系日趋薄弱，政府偿还新兴市场投资者的储蓄没有多大盈余。因此国际发展机构更有可能作为赞助商。别林斯基先生现在印度致力于即将发展的“社会效益债券”，为（印度）拉贾斯塔邦和哥伦比亚的女孩改善教育成果，降低少女怀孕率和学校失学率。</p>

<p>As the buzz about SIBs increases, the questions will also become more searching. Projects which take many years to have an effect (the impact of pre-school education on university admissions, say) will not interest investors. Good data are crucial for measuring outcomes: that can be a problem in developing countries.</p>

<p>随着有关建立“社会效益债券”的风声四起，问题也变得更加的透彻。需要多年才能产生效果的项目工程（例如，学前教育对大学招生录取的影响）不会引起投资者的兴趣。良好数据对衡量成果至关重要：在发展中国家可能是一个问题。</p>

<p>The hardest questions concern the returns that investors will demand if SIBs are to attract serious amounts of money. The Peterborough SIB dangles an annualised return of up to 13% if reoffending rates go down by enough; but investors lose everything if recidivism does not fall by at least 7.5%. That sort of equity risk is not going to appeal to many, acknowledges Nick Hurd, the British government minister for civil society. “SIBs need to evolve so that they become more like a debt instrument.”</p>

<p>涉及回报最难的问题是：如果“社会效益债券”吸引大量资金，投资者将会有所要求。如果再犯率大大下降，彼得伯勒“社会效益债券”机构年回报率达到13%，这一点仍有待推敲，如果再犯率高于7.5%以上，投资者将血本无归。很多人对这种股票风险不“感冒”。英国政府民间团体部长尼克赫德表示： “社会效益债券”需要改进，变得更像一种类似的债务证券。</p>

<p><strong>Sibling rivals</strong><br/>
<strong>同行竞争对手</strong></p>

<p>Signs of just such an evolution are becoming apparent. The New York city SIB reinforces Goldman’s reputation for dealmaking as much as its philanthropic image: a guarantee from Bloomberg Philanthropies, a foundation, caps the amount of money the bank can lose if recidivism targets are not met. Some think this model, with philanthropists ensuring that a portion of investors’ principal is returned, is the way to bring in more capital.</p>

<p>这种改善的迹象变得越来越明显。位于纽约市的“社会效益债券”机构加强高盛公司交易声誉和慈善形象：彭博慈善基金会的担保规定了再犯率没有达到预期目标的银行损失上限额。有些人认为，除了慈善家确保投资者的一部分本金得到回报，这一模式是吸引更多资金的方法。</p>

<p>Another option is to blend the returns from SIBs with other assets. Allia, a British charity devoted to social investment, this month made a SIB available to retail investors for the first time. Of every £1,000 invested, £780 goes to a fixed-rate loan to a social-housing provider, which when repaid with interest will give investors their money back. Another £200 will go into an SIB providing therapeutic support to troubled children in Essex, which offers investors the potential for a return. (Fees eat up the other £20.) These are still early days, but big ideas often start small.</p>

<p>另一个方法是融合“社会效益债券”机构的收益和其他资产。英国慈善机构“阿利亚”致力于社会投资，这个月首次将“社会效益债券”提供给零售投资者。每1千英镑的投资资金里，780英镑作为固定利率贷款提供给社保住房提供者，一旦本息和利息得到偿付，投资者的资金将会得到偿还。剩余的200英镑将投入“社会效益债券”，为埃塞克斯的困难儿童提供医学治疗，这也为投资者提供了潜在的收益。（还有20英镑用于其他费用）现在还是起步阶段，千里之行，始于足下。</p>

<strong>一路点击，测试理财习惯</strong></p>

<p>Feb 2nd 2013 | ATLANTA |From the print edition</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/290-width/images/print-edition/20130202_FNP002_0.jpg" alt="Blood bars and debt bunnies" /></p>

<p>ONE way to learn basic financial literacy is to sit in a classroom and listen to someone drone on about retirement accounts and financial charges. An alternative is to run a nightclub for vampires and rake in money by getting your customers the blood-type they want, while socking away enough cash for retirement (a long one—you’re undead).</p>

<p>学习理财常识的一个方法就是：坐在教室听某人喋喋不休的讲着退休金账户以及融资费用相关的知识。另外一种方法就是开一家吸血鬼夜总会，给他们提供所需血型，大捞一笔，或者为退休存储足够的钱（如果你是不死之身，这一过程遥遥无期）。</p>

<!--more-->


<p>That is the scenario of “Bite Club”, a video game created by Doorways to Dreams (D2D) Fund, a Boston-based non-profit organisation that works on improving the finances of low- and middle-income consumers. D2D released its first prototype game in 2009, and its library now totals five games. The other titles include “Farm Blitz”, which challenges players to harvest crops from Uncle Felix’s farm while staving off ravenous rabbits (the bunnies represent debt); and “Celebrity Calamity”, in which you are a money manager who keeps a Hollywood starlet happy by keeping her out of debt.</p>

<p>这是波士顿非盈利机构“梦想基金之门”（注释1）创作的电子游戏《齿痕俱乐部》中的情节，该基金会致力于改善中低收入消费者的财政状况。2009年，“通向梦想基金会”发布首个《虐杀原形》游戏（注释2），其程序库现共有5种游戏。其他游戏分别是《农场闪电战》，即要求玩家避开贪婪的兔子（兔子代表债务），从菲利克斯大叔的农场收获农作物，以及《名人灾难》，在这个游戏中，玩家扮演一位资金经理人，让一位好莱坞新秀远离债务困扰，使其无后顾之忧。</p>

<p>Although the scenarios vary, the five games share a few crucial attributes. Like “Angry Birds” or “Tetris”, they have no extensive back stories and are easy to understand. They rely on real-world decision-making: players have to spend on necessary expenses while also saving for retirement and avoiding excess debt.</p>

<p>尽管情节迥异，但是这五种游戏有着共同的一些重要特性。如《愤怒的小鸟》和《俄罗斯方块》，不需要许多的背后操作指示，容易理解。这些游戏依靠现实决策：玩家必须花费必要的费用，同时也得为退休储蓄资金，避免过多债务。</p>

<p>Most importantly, they seem to help people. D2D recently released a paper showing the results of a randomised control trial, in which participants took financial self-confidence and financial-knowledge quizzes and then were assigned either to play “Farm Blitz” or to read a pamphlet before taking the quizzes again. Both groups improved on both measures, and although the pamphlet-readers improved more, the comparison that matters most is not whether D2D’s games are better than reading, but whether they are better than nothing.</p>

<p>最为重要的是，他们似乎是在帮助人们。“梦想基金之门”最近发布的一份报告显示了一次随机控制试验的结果，在这个试验中，参与者进行金融自信和金融知识测试，然后被指定玩《农场闪电战》或者阅读说明书之后再进行测试。在这两种测试措施中，两组都有所改善，尽管说明书阅读者的改善效果更佳，这一比较最重要的不在于“梦想基金之门”游戏要比阅读说明书要好，而是在于聊胜于无。</p>

<p>Financial-literacy education can be off-putting, after all. D2D’s least popular game is “Refund Rush”, in which players act as a financial adviser helping clients decide what to do with their tax refunds. Wouldn’t you choose vampires?</p>

<p>毕竟，金融扫盲教育可能会使人感到不愉快，“梦想基金之门”欢迎指数最低的游戏《职业理财师》，玩家扮演一位金融顾问，帮助客户决定如何利用退税资金。为何不选择吸血鬼呢？</p>

<p>注释2：虐杀原形（Prototype）是由Radical Entertainment公司制作，美国动视发行于2009年6月9日发售的开放式科幻自由动作冒险游戏，玩家将扮演一位由病毒集合成的生物体，还要与军队和各种变异生物战斗。该游戏以高超的自由度、肆无忌惮破坏与暴力杀戮为卖点，应用Radical公司独立开发的钛合金游戏引擎IV(Titanium game engine)，游戏的风格类似侠盗猎车手系列，不同的是，当主角抓住路人或敌人时便可以吸收他们的记忆、能力，甚至能变成他们的样子以进行伪装。</p>

<strong>首次对战争罪行的定罪引发争议</strong></p>

<p>Jan 26th 2013 |From the print edition</p>

<p>MORE than 41 years after the deaths of as many as 3m people in Bangladesh’s war of secession from Pakistan, a Bangladeshi war crimes tribunal has given its first verdict. On January 21st it sentenced Abul Kalam Azad to death in absentia for genocide and murder committed during the nine-month war in 1971. The verdict is being seen as a victory for Sheikh Hasina, the prime minister, and her Awami League party, who have made the tribunal an important part of her term in office.</p>

<p>孟加拉国曾为脱离巴基斯坦引发的战争致使3百万人丧生，近42年过去了，如今孟加拉国战争军事法庭对此进行首次裁决，于1月21日对阿布尔•卡拉姆•阿扎德在1971年长达9个月的战争中所犯下的种族灭绝及屠杀罪行进行缺席审判，处以死刑。这一裁决是谢赫•哈西娜总理和其人民联盟政党的一大胜利，也是她任期的一个重要垫脚石。</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Bangladeshis have waited decades for justice and the aims of the tribunal are broadly popular, but critics say the process has been politicised to target allies of Sheikh Hasina’s main opponent, former prime minister Khaleda Zia, head of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). There have also been questions raised about its impartiality. In December The Economist reported on contacts by e-mail and Skype between the presiding judge in one of the tribunals and a lawyer in Belgium who was not an official part of the court. The judge eventually resigned and was replaced. The verdict on Mr Azad came from a second tribunal.</p>

<p>孟加拉国期待正义已有数年，这次审判的目的深得人心，但是批评家认为这次裁决已被政治化，主要是针对谢赫•哈西娜&lt;注释1>即孟加拉国国民党领导人兼前总理卡莉达•齐亚。也有很多人质疑这次裁决的公正性。12月，《经济学家》报道此次审判的其中一位首席法官和一位比利时律师联系的邮件内容及网络电话记录，这位法官最终辞职，被取而代之。第二次开庭审判对阿扎德做出了判决。</p>

<p>In the judgment Mr Azad is described as a former leader of the youth wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, a party in then East Pakistan and still Bangladesh’s biggest Islamic party today. Its youth wing was the main source of paramilitaries supporting Pakistan in its efforts to prevent East Pakistan’s independence. Its members are alleged to have abducted and murdered dozens of civilians. Mr Azad himself was accused of killing at least 12 Hindus and of rape. He then became a well-connected political figure in Bangladesh and a presenter of popular Islamic television programmes. He fled the country last year and is believed to be in Pakistan.</p>

<p>这次审判把阿扎德描绘成伊斯兰大会党青年团前领导人，该党现在仍然是孟加拉国（当时的东巴基斯坦）最大的伊斯兰党。这一青年团是协助巴基斯坦人们阻止东巴基斯坦独立的主要辅助军事力量，该团成员也涉嫌绑架和杀害许多的平民百姓。阿扎德本人被指控杀害至少12名印度教徒和涉嫌强奸罪。他曾在孟加拉国政治界人脉广泛，而且在炙手可热的伊斯兰电视节目中担任主持人。他去年叛逃孟加拉国，据信现在在巴基斯坦。</p>

<p>Mrs Zia has found it impossible to distance her party from Jamaat-e-Islami, an ally whose support the BNP needs if it is to win the election, likely to take place this year. Among the ten other senior figures to be tried are two leading party officials, both former ministers in Mrs Zia’s 2001-2006 government. It may be that almost the entire leadership of Jamaat will be hanged before the polls. So, too, may two members of Mrs Zia’s party, including one of her close advisers. Sheikh Hasina will hope that the taint of 1971 will make the BNP-Jamaat alliance so toxic to voters that she will be returned to power.</p>

<p>齐亚（音译）&lt;注释2>觉得不能和伊斯兰教党对立，因为孟加拉国国民党需要该联盟的支持，来赢得今年可能举行的大选。十个被审的高级官员中有两个是大会党重要官员，而且还曾在齐亚2001—2006年执政期间担任部长。整个伊斯兰教领导势力也许会在民意调查之前全军覆没，齐亚所在党派的两名成员（其中包括她的一名亲密顾问）也不例外，谢赫•哈西娜希望1971年发生的这一丑闻来丑化该国国民党-伊斯兰教联盟，从而使自己获得选民的支持，重新执掌政权。</p>

<strong>平民英雄</strong></p>

<p>Jan 23rd 2013, 4:52 by The Economist | CHENGDU</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/2013/01/blogs/analects/li_chengpeng.jpg" alt="李承鹏" /></p>

<!--more-->


<p>LIU XIAOBO, China’s first non-Tibetan to wear the laurel of a Nobel peace prize, languishes quietly in prison and the artist known as Ai Weiwei remains better known abroad than at home. But a number of writers and activists whose names are not so famous overseas have gained a following within China by daring to tweak the tail of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>中国第一位获得诺贝尔和平奖的非藏族人士刘晓波遭囚禁，静度余生，著名艺术家艾未未在国内的知名度远不及在国外的知名度。但是许多不为国外所熟知得作家和积极份子敢于揭共产党所短，在国内得到许多人的支持。</p>

<p>Perhaps chief among them would be a former sports writer, Li Chengpeng. Mr Li has recently stirred up a storm with a new book, a collection of sharp essays on his country’s social ills, titled “Everybody in the World Knows”. During his book tour in January he was adored by fans, physically attacked by enemies and finally silenced by the Chinese authorities.
也许这些人的主要人物是前体育记者李承鹏，他的新书《全世界人民都知道》是一部辛辣批判国家的社会弊病的杂文集，在最近弄得满城风雨。在一月的新书签售活动中，李承鹏受其粉丝追捧，遭受其反对者掌掴并被官方禁言。</p>

<p>Thousands of supporters turned out to meet the author in Chengdu, Beijing and Shenzhen. On January 12th, just before he appeared at his book signing in Chengdu, Mr Li took stock of the rules that had been laid down for the aunch and announced to his 6.7m followers on Sina Weibo, China’s homegrown version of Twitter: “I am not allowed to speak, not allowed to give opening remarks, I am not even allowed to say ‘Happy New Year’ or ‘Thank you all’.” Instead he wore a black mask over his mouth and the words “I love you all” written on his shirt. The crowd roared its approval, and snapped up copies of his book by the armload.</p>

<p>数千支持者在成都，北京和深圳参加他的签售会。1月·12日，在他四川签售活动之前，李仔细估量了上级对这次签售活动所下达的命令并在微博（中国版本的推特）上对其670万关注者说：“不准我说话，不准我致开场白，连“新年好，谢谢你们”也不准说。”他戴着黑色的口罩，在其衬衫上写上“我爱你们”。在场的群众欢呼雀跃，抢购李的新书。</p>

<p>His reception in Beijing went less smoothly. One self-proclaimed Maoist hurled a kitchen knife at him and another punched him in the face. Some Maoists regard him as a traitor for his criticism of the Communist Party. Since the knife-throwing incident, and then further cries of treason at the book signing in Shenzhen, the police have chosen to rein in Mr Li. He texted at least one reporter to explain that he was being taken away for a chat. An appearance in Guangzhou was cancelled suddenly.</p>

<p>他的北京签售也并非顺利。一位自称“毛派”人士向李扔了一把菜刀，某人对李脸上“赠”与一掌掴。李承鹏因批判共产党，一些“毛派”人士将其视为“汉奸”。自深圳新书签售会上的掷刀事件以及随即的“卖国贼”呼声，警方已对李进行约束，李对相关记者证实他被警方带走就此事做笔录，广州签售会也随即取消。</p>

<p>Li Chengpeng is no stranger to threats and government pressure. Working as a sportswriter from the early 1990s to 2009, he chose to focus his reporting on rampant corruption, which culminated in a book called “Chinese Football: The Inside Story”, published in January 2010. It detailed match-fixing and bribery across the country and brought down the wrath of incensed trainers, “patriotic readers” and government censors. Chen Yiming, trainer of the Chongqing Lifan club, brought a suit against Mr Li in 2009 which succeeded in incurring fines of 200,000 yuan ($32,000) and the demand that the published reporting be retracted publicly. Mr Li refused and in December 2012 a Guangzhou court overturned the verdict on appeal. Mr Li was found not guilty of libel, and his articles were judged to be “non-damaging”. Mr Chen, the trainer, was forced to pay the court’s costs.</p>

<p>李承鹏对威胁和政府的施压已是司空见惯。他在90年代初期至2009年期间从事体育专栏报道工作，之后专注报道泛滥猖獗的腐败问题，其书名为《中国足球内幕》，并在2010年1月出版，详细介绍了全国假球和贿赂等黑幕，以及打击了足球教练员的嚣张气焰。重庆力帆俱乐部教练陈亦明（音译）在2009年对李提起诉讼，成功胜诉，法院判决李赔偿20万（3.2万美元）以及召回发表的足球报道，李承鹏拒绝接受并上诉，2012年12月广州一家法院推翻这一判决。李承鹏被判无罪，其文章也被判定对社会没有危害。教练员陈不得不支付法庭费用。</p>

<p>Seasoned at playing the provocateur, Mr Li moved from reporting on sport to writing essays on politics and society soon after the Sichuan earthquake of 2008, which killed more than 80,000 people. His writing on the struggles of common people after the disaster brought his work to a whole new audience of internet-savvy young Chinese. He went on to publish a novel in 2011, “Li Kele Protests Demolitions”. Mr Li’s “Li Kele” was an immediate hit; the descriptions of ordinary people who united together to fight faceless forces and venality propelled the writer into the arms of a more organized new audience: China’s advocates for social reform.</p>

<p>李承鹏在发起“挑衅活动”方面有丰富的阅历，他以前是报道体育新闻，自2008年四川地震（死亡人数超过8万）之后不久，他开始写有关政治方面的文章。对老百姓灾后重建的文章吸引了网络上一批全新的年轻人。2011年，他出版了一本小说《李可乐抗拆记》，这本书立即得到强烈反响，小说中关于平民老百姓联合反抗幕后势力以及腐败问题的描绘使作者融入一个更有组织的新读者群：中国社会改革的提倡者。</p>

<p>Later that year Mr Li announced that he would be running for public office in Chengdu as an independent. Although his election campaign was never allowed to get under way (candidates for office are carefully screened by the Communist Party and eventually Mr Li failed his background check), he gained a new degree of credibility. Here, it seemed, was a man who would back up his words with actions.</p>

<p>此后，李承鹏宣布将以无党派身份竞选成都公职，虽然他的竞选活动尚未允许启动（竞选公职的候选人需经过共产党的精心筛选，李最终未能通过背景调查），但是他的公信力获得提高，还有一个人似乎用行动来支持李的文章。</p>

<p>At the book launch in Chengdu, an elderly man named Liu Shahe sat behind Mr Li. Mr Liu is one of the signatories of Charter 08, the document demanding a list political reforms that Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel laureate, was jailed for drafting. Mr Li tweeted Mr Liu’s words to him—“You man of words, just keep writing”—and said the encouragement from the older man had reduced him to tears.</p>

<p>在成都签售会上，一位老人站在李的身后，老人名叫流沙河，是《08宪章》的其中一名签署者，该文书要求一系列政治改革，诺贝尔奖获得者刘晓波因起草该文书被囚禁。李在微博上写上刘对他所说的话-“文人，写下去即是胜利”&ndash;称这位老人的鼓励让他潸然泪下。</p>

<p>Since that relatively thunderous clap, Mr Li seems to be trying to turn his volume down a notch. In a recent post to his blog, Li said he would be doing small events only, with friends and close supporters. He urged his fans to pay attention to “bigger issues like corruption, food safety and pollution” and not focus so much on the man and his book.</p>

<p>自这件事传得沸沸扬扬以来，李似乎试图低调行事。他在最近的一篇博文中说他将和朋友以及联系密切的支持者只做做小事，他敦促粉丝们关注更大的问题，如腐败，食品安全，污染问题等，而不是过多集中在他本人和这本书上。</p>

<strong>被迫消失在历史长河中</strong></p>

<p>Jan 21st 2013, 18:25 by M.R. | CAIRO</p>

<p><img src="http://media.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/2013/01/blogs/pomegranate/20130126_map501.jpg" alt="沙特阿拉伯：被迫消失在历史长河中" /></p>

<!--more-->


<p>LIKE much that moves in Twitter-mad Saudi Arabia these days, it started with a single message. A lady in Dammam, the hub of the oil industry on the kingdom’s Gulf coast, tweeted a complaint from a local shopping mall. Agents of the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice (CPVPV), she said, were causing an unpleasant scene. The government-salaried vigilantes, a bearded auxiliary police force familiarly known to Saudis as the Hayaa, had marched officiously into an educational exhibit featuring plaster models of dinosaurs, turned off the lights and ordered everyone out, frightening children and alarming their parents.</p>

<p>就如最近发生在沙特阿拉伯的诸多事件，“推特”（音译）的流行，导火线源于一条的简单短信，这一事件也不例外。沙特阿拉伯波斯湾海岸石油港口达曼一位女士在“推特”发微博抱怨当地一家购物商场。她称“扬善惩恶委员会”工作人员是造成这一不愉快场面的罪魁祸首。政府自卫队即沙特人们熟识的满面胡须的“哈亚”辅助警察队强行进入以一家恐龙石膏模型的教育展览馆，切断电源并命令所有人离开，使孩子们及其父母受到惊吓。</p>

<p>It was unclear precisely why the religious police objected to the exhibit, which apparently had been innocently featured at shopping centres across the Gulf for decades. Malls are one of the few public spaces where Saudis mix socially, and so often draw the Hayaa’s attentions. Gone, however, are the days when its agents can go about their business unchallenged.</p>

<p>该展览馆数年来一直是海湾购物中心的特色,宗教警察为何反对这一展览的目的尚不明确。购物中心是沙特人社交的少数公共场所之一，因此常常引起哈亚的注意。然而，委员会工作人员不能像以前那样为所欲为的处理问题了。</p>

<p>Within minutes of the incident, a freshly minted Arabic Twitter hashtag, #Dammam-Hayaa-Closes-Dinosaur-Show, was generating scores of theories about their motives. Perhaps, suggested one, there was a danger that citizens might start worshipping dinosaur statues instead of God. Maybe it was just a temporary measure, said another, until the Hayaa can separate male and female dinosaurs and put them in separate rooms. Surely, declared a third, one of the lady dinosaurs had been caught in public without a male guardian. A fourth announced an all-points police alert for Barney the Dinosaur, while another suggested it was too early to judge until it was clear what the dinosaurs were wearing.</p>

<p>在该事件发生后的几分钟之内，一个刚形成的阿拉伯“推特”主题标签（达曼-哈亚关闭恐龙展览）引起了关于宗教警察动机的诸多推测。有人认为，人们可能会信仰恐龙而不是上帝，这也许是一种危险；有人则觉得这也许只是哈亚区分雌雄恐龙且将其放置在单独房间之前的一个临时措施；当然，还有人则宣称一只雌性恐龙在没有雄性恐龙的“保护下”，当众被人”猥亵“；另外还有人称所有现场警察提高对巴尼恐龙标本警惕，而其他人认为，除非先了解恐龙身上穿的什么，现在评价还为时过早。</p>

<p>Several contributors injected bawdy innuendo into their comments. Noting that one of the displays showed a dinosaur riding on the back of another, one message declared that this was obviously sexually suggestive and possibly could be categorised as a Westernising influence. &ldquo;I confess,&rdquo; declared one penitent, &ldquo;I saw a naked dinosaur thigh and felt aroused.&rdquo; Another tweet provided this helpful tip to the suspicious CPVPV: &ldquo;No, no, that long thing is a tail!&rdquo;</p>

<p>一些撰稿人在其评论中进行了含沙射影的讽刺，指出有一展览展出一只恐龙骑在另外一只恐龙的背上，有人称这明显暗含“性”内容且可能将其视为是西化影响的产物。一位忏悔者称，”我承认，赤裸的恐龙大腿刺激了我的性欲望。“另外一位”推特“用户向多疑的扬善惩恶委员会提供了一条有益的建议：”不，不，这长长的东西是一条尾巴！“</p>

<p>But most of the messages singled out the religious police for ridicule. &ldquo;They worried that people would find the dinosaurs more highly evolved than themselves,&rdquo; explained one. &ldquo;It’s the Hayaa that should be stuffed and mounted so future generations can learn about extinct animals,&rdquo; quipped another. This message adopted a more pedantic tone: &ldquo;Dinosaurs are a paleontological life form from an ancient geological era, and our clerics are a paleontological life form from an ancient social era.&rdquo; &ldquo;Hello? Stone Age? We have some of your people; can you please come and collect them?&rdquo; pleaded one tweep. Another wrote: &ldquo;If the dinosaurs were still alive they’d be saying, thank God for extinction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>但是大多数评论针对宗教警察进行讥讽。有人解释，”他们担心人们会发现恐龙的进化比他们更加高级“。有人嘲弄，”哈亚应该有标本让后代了解灭绝了的动物。“ 这条评论采用了一种更为迂腐的语气：”恐龙是古老地质时期的一种古生物学生命形式，牧师是古老社会时期的一种古生物学生命形式。一位“推特”用户“ 用恳求的语气讽刺 ，”拜托？石器时代？我们有你们的一些同类，麻烦来“收了”他们？“另一位用户写道：“如果恐龙现在还没有灭绝，它们可能会为自己的灭绝而感谢上帝。”</p>

<strong>奥巴马打响美国控抢对策的第一枪</strong></p>

<p>Jan 16th 2013, 22:50 by Economist.com | NEW YORK</p>

<p><img src="http://media.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/2013/01/blogs/democracy-america/guns590.jpg" alt="Gun control-美国枪支管控" /></p>

<!--more-->


<p>GRACE MCDONNELL’S parents gave one of her paintings to Barack Obama. The seven-year-old, who dreamed of being a painter, was shot dead in her classroom last month. The picture now hangs in the president’s study as a reminder to act. Even in a country as accustomed to gun violence as America, the murder of 26 people, including 20 children, in a Newtown, Connecticut school last month was especially shocking. On that day a tearful Mr Obama said serious action was needed to prevent any more tragedies. On January 16th Mr Obama, along with Vice-President Joe Biden, who headed the president’s gun task-force, unveiled the most sweeping gun-control proposals Washington, DC has seen for two decades. Whether they will be implemented or make much difference is another matter.</p>

<p>格蕾丝-麦克唐娜（音译）的父母送给奥巴马一副由格蕾丝作的画。这个曾经梦想成为画家的7岁小女孩于上个月在其教室被枪杀。这幅画现挂在总统的书房，提醒人们采取行动。甚至是枪支暴力泛滥的美国，上个月在纽镇发生的康尼狄格州校园枪击惨案造成26人丧生，其中包括20名小孩，这一事件震惊世界。奥巴马在惨案发生这一天含泪发表讲话，表示要采取行动，阻止类似悲剧再次发生。1月16日，奥巴马和负责限枪事宜的副总统乔-拜登在白宫公布二十年来最为全面的枪支限制提案，这些对策能否付诸实施或带来多大改观得另当别论。</p>

<p>The president’s plan was inspired not just by the children killed in Newtown, but by the more than 30,000 deaths caused by guns every year. Mr Obama announced 23 executive orders, which do not need congressional approval. These include strengthening the system of background checks (which is notoriously ineffective) and providing more support to law-enforcement agencies. Another order seeks to make schools safer by ensuring that each one has an emergency management plan (most of them, including the Newton one, already do).</p>

<p>纽镇发生的儿童枪击事件以及每年有超过3万人死亡枪支泛滥的现状促使奥巴马制定这一计划。奥巴马公布了无需国会批准的23项行政法令。其内容包括加强购枪背景检查体系（这体系的办事效率低下，人尽皆知）和加大对执法机构的投入。另一法令是加强学校安保，确保每一个学校有紧急事务管理计划（许多学校，包括纽镇所在的小学，现已有该计划）。</p>

<p>But Mr Obama will need congressional backing for the main part of his plan: a proposal to renew an assault-weapons ban that went into effect in 1994 but expired ten years later. The ban would include, as it did back in 1994, a ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines, containing more than ten rounds. The trouble is that ban, especially the magazine part of it, proved impossible to enforce.</p>

<p>但是奥巴马需要国会的支持他计划中的主要部分：恢复1994年生效并于2004年到期的禁止攻击性武器方案。这一禁令包括1994年实行禁止拥有超过10发高性能供弹装置的规定。困难的是，这一禁令，尤其有关弹药方面，不可能实施。</p>

<p>States, meanwhile, have jumped the gun. Andrew Cuomo, New York’s governor and a gun-owner, signed the NY Safe Act on January 15th. The state, which already had strong gun laws, has now banned military-style assault weapons, and has mandated universal background checks, including on buyers of ammunition. Martin O’Malley, Maryland’s governor, is about to introduce a sweeping gun-control package which echoes many of New York’s measures. Colorado’s governor has called for background checks for private gun sales, which are currently exempt. Deval Patrick, the governor of Massachusetts, wants to limit gun sales to one a month. Of course, one can do quite a lot of damage with one gun a month.</p>

<p>同时，很多州已经开始提前行动了。1月15日，纽约州长兼枪支业主安德鲁-库摩（音译）签署了《纽约安全法案》。纽约州早已有严格的枪支法律，现已禁止使用军事化攻击性武器，以及授权进行包括弹药购买者的全面背景检查。马里兰州长马丁-奥马莱（音译）效仿纽约州实行的许多措施，即将采取全面控抢计划。科罗拉多州长提倡对目前豁免的私人枪支销售进行背景调查。马萨诸塞州长德瓦尔-帕特奈克（音译）想要限制每人每月只能买一支枪。当然，就算是一个月一支枪还是可以造成巨大破坏。</p>

<p>Cities, too, are taking a stand. Since the Newtown shooting, more than 100 more mayors have joined Mayors Against Illegal Guns, the 800-strong coalition founded by Michael Bloomberg, New York’s mayor.</p>

<p>许多城市也表明立场。自从纽镇的枪击事件以来，又有100多位市长参与了纽约市长迈克尔&#8221;布隆伯格发起的 “反对非法枪支”这一由800位市长组成的强大联盟。</p>

<p>Welcome as these state and city actions are, without federal backup they are not much use. They may also be vulnerable to recision by the Supreme Court. Would-be killers need only cross state lines to places with weak gun laws to get access to weapons. Nor is it clear whether the president’s plan would have prevented the Newtown massacre. There, the shooter did not have a background check; he used his mother’s guns.</p>

<p>尽管这些州和市采取的行动受到欢迎，但没有联邦政府的支持，也不会有多大成效。美国最高法院很有可能废除这些措施。潜在杀手只需越过州界限，到枪支管控不严格的地方就能得到武器。总统公布的计划能否避免类似纽镇枪杀杀事件尚不明朗。因为在该事件中，枪击凶手使用其母亲的枪，本人并没有受到背景调查。</p>

<p>Mr Obama faces steep opposition, and not just from congressional opponents: even his fellow Democrat, Harry Reid, the majority leader of the Senate, has indicated that the assault-weapons ban will be a hard sell. While states like New York and California are moving to strengthen gun laws, other states are doing the opposite. Lawmakers in Arizona and Texas, for instance, intend to introduce bills that would loosen gun restrictions. A Kentucky sheriff has said he will not enforce any new gun laws that he deems unconstitutional.</p>

<p>奥巴马面对居高不下的反对意见，不仅仅是国会共和党的反对：其民主党派人士兼参议院多数党领袖哈里-瑞特（音译）指出这一禁止攻击性武器法令如同“强买强卖”。尽管很多州如纽约州和加利福尼亚州正加强枪支法律，但他州的做法却相反。例如，亚利桑那州和德克萨斯州的立法者打算推行放松枪支限制的法案。肯塔基州的一位地方司法官称他不会实施任何新的违反宪法的枪支法律。</p>

<p>Most shockingly, gun sales have soared in recent weeks. In the month since the Newtown shooting 250,000 more people have joined the National Rifle Association, which has vowed to oppose the ban. The group is getting so cocky that it launched a free shooting app this week. For an extra 99 cents, players can use a MK-11 sniper rifle to shoot coffin-shaped targets.</p>

<p>最让人震惊的是，枪支销售量在最近几周急剧上升。自纽镇枪击事件以来，已有25万多人加入了誓言反对这一禁令的美国步枪协会，该协会表现越来越“嚣张”，在这周推行了一个免费射击应用游戏。玩家只要支付额外的99美分，就可以使用MK-11狙击步枪射击棺材型目标。</p>

<strong>单打独斗</strong></p>

<p>Jan 14th 2013, 12:55 by S.P. | PARIS</p>

<p><img src="http://media.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/2013/01/blogs/charlemagne/20130119_eup501.jpg" alt="法国外交政策" /></p>

<p>FRANCE’S decision on January 11th to begin air strikes against Islamist rebel positions in northern Mali, designed to prevent “the establishment of a terrorist state” in the African Sahel, contained elements of both surprise and familiarity.</p>

<p>法国决定1月11日对马里北部伊斯兰叛军武装据点进行空袭，以防止其在非洲撒赫勒地区建立恐怖主义国家，这一决定让人惊讶但又有点司空见惯。</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The surprise was that François Hollande, the president, a Socialist leader not known for decisive action and untried in foreign policy, moved so swiftly to order French fighter jets and attack helicopters into action. Using warplanes based both in France and at a permanent base in nearby Chad, the French struck rebel columns advancing out of Islamist-held territory and towards Bamako, the Malian capital. Such groups, with ties to Al-Qaeda, have ruled a big chunk or the north of the country since March last year.</p>

<p>众所周知，法国总统兼社会党领导人弗朗索瓦•奥朗德在外交政策上不会果断决策和进行尝试性行动，而这次却迅速下令法国战机和武装直升机采取行动，这一反差让人感到惊讶。从法国开赴的战机以及乍得长期基地的战机击败驻在伊斯兰教领土至马里首都巴尔科地区的叛军部队。自去年3月以来，这个与基地组织联系的团伙占领马里大部分地区或北部地区。</p>

<p>The French government said that the weekend air strikes, part of what it is calling Operation Serval, had stopped the rebel advance, and helped Malian troops to regain control of the town of Konna; one French helicopter pilot was killed, as well as a dozen Malian soldiers. On the third day of air attacks, the French struck deeper into Islamist-held territory, targeting training camps and logistics centres, according to Jean-Yves Le Drian, the defence minister.</p>

<p>法国政府称周末进行的“薮猫行动”空袭打击已阻止叛军进攻，帮助马里军队收复了孔纳镇，已有一位法国直升机飞行员和十二位马里士兵丧生。法国国防部长Jean-Yves Le Drian称，空袭的第三天，法军深入挺进伊斯兰教地区，重点打击叛军训练营和物流中心，</p>

<p>France has certainly been in the lead in pushing for intervention in Mali. It drafted a United Nations Security Council resolution authorising a regional African force to retake rebel-held territory, which was unanimously passed last October. In a speech to a gathering of French-speaking countries in Senegal last year, Mr Hollande spoke of a “reign of terror” in Islamist-held Mali, where sharia law has been applied in the furthest north.</p>

<p>法国在马里军事干预中的确是有着主导作用。法国向联合国安理会起草的一份授权非洲当地军队收复叛军占据领土的决议在去年10月一致通过。去年在塞内加尔举行的法语国家会议中，奥朗德谈到在伊斯兰教为主的马里的恐怖统治，伊斯兰教反政府已深入马里最北方地区。</p>

<p>France is particularly worried that the Sahel is becoming an “Afrighanistan”—a breeding ground for terrorists—thanks in part to modern weaponry that has spilled over the Libyan border after the war there. France itself has been named as a target by groups based in the north; this weekend, as the airstrikes began, the country raised its terrorism-security alert. France also has strong commercial links in the region, and there are currently eight French hostages in the region.</p>

<p>法国特别担心萨赫勒会成为另外一个“阿富汗”—恐怖分子的温床—部分原因是自利比亚边境爆发的内战来，先进武器的使用向周边国家扩展。法国已成为马里北部的基地叛军报复目标，当空袭开始之时，法国在上周末提高反恐预警方案级别。法国在该地区拥有强大经济联系，反叛组织目前仍挟持8名法国人质。</p>

<p>Mr Hollande had also made clear that it was no longer his intention for France to play the role of regional gendarme, stepping in to prop up African rulers, as has been the post-colonial tradition under the Fifth Republic. “Françafrique”, the opaque mesh of military, political and commercial ties, was over, he claimed. Until now, he had insisted that France would offer no more than logistical support to a regional African force, which was laboriously being put together for this autumn.</p>

<p>奥朗德也明确表示，他不会采取像法兰西第五共和国的后殖民主义传统以往的做法，让法国充当该地区军队进行军事干预帮助非洲统治者已不再是他的意愿。他称，政治与商业相交织的不透明网即“法国非洲”已成过去式。他至今仍坚称法国将只对非洲地区军队提供后勤支持，并在今年秋季全力付诸实施。</p>

<p>Which is where the element of familiarity comes in. The reality, acknowledged privately by French sources, is that the Malian army was in no position to defend itself, and that the regional African force was going to take too long to assemble. Mr Hollande stressed that France was acting with a legal international mandate, and responding to a request from the Malian president, Dioncounda Traoré, for help. In a diplomatic breakthrough of sorts, Algeria granted France permission for fighter jets to fly over its airpace. Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, said on French radio on January 13th that France had little choice but to intervene urgently or Islamist forces might have made it to Bamako, with “appalling consequences”.</p>

<p>让人司空见惯的是：法国媒体私下报道马里军队没有能力进行自卫，而且非洲地区部队要花很多时间组建军队，这都是现实情况。奥朗德强调法国是在国际合法授权下采取行动，以及对马里总统迪翁昆达•特拉奥雷请求支援做出的回应。阿尔及利亚准许法国战机飞越其领空，这是外交上的一大突破。法国外交部长洛朗-法比尤斯在1月13日通过法国电台表示法国别无选择，只能迅速采取军事干预，否则伊斯兰叛军可能会在巴马科造成可怕的后果。</p>

<p>However much successive French presidents say that they want to put an end to post-colonial intervention in Africa, with few other takers for the job it usually proves irresistible at some point. Nicolas Sarkozy, Mr Hollande’s predecessor, had also promised a new era, only to end up sending the French army to help Côte d’Ivoire forcibly evict Laurent Gbagbo, the loser of that country’s presidential election, from office.</p>

<p>尽管法国总统连续强调法国想要结束在非洲的后殖民主义干预，而对于其他少数国家来说，这种干预在某些情况下通常是不可抗拒的，法国前任总统尼古拉-萨科奇曾许诺开辟一个新的时代，结果只是派遣法国军队帮助科特迪瓦共和国强迫总统竞选落选者洛朗•巴博下台。</p>

<p>The question now is how long the French are prepared to intervene, and how fast a decent African ground force can realistically be put in place. Mr Fabius has talked of “a question of weeks” for the French intervention. He insists that its main contribution is air power, with the few hundred special forces on the ground essentially picking out and verifying targets.</p>

<p>现在的问题是法国准备多长时间进行干预以及训练尚可的非洲陆军多快实现真正作战。法比尤斯表示法国干预是数周以来一直讨论的问题。他坚称空军以及主要辨认和确认袭击目标的几百地面特种部队是作战的主力。</p>

<p>It is the West African force that is supposed to carry out the operation to retake the north from Islamists, and there is a regional meeting on this now set for January 19th. Initial contingents of troops from Senegal, Niger, Burkina Faso, Nigeria and Togo are now due to arrive within days. But a properly manned force will still take time to assemble. France, in short, is likely to find itself involved for a while. Mr Hollande himself has stated that the French operation would last “as long as necessary”.</p>

<p>据称西非军队将采取行动从“伊斯兰教支持者”手中夺取北部地区，1月19号将对此问题举行地区会议。塞内加尔，尼日尔，布基纳法索，尼日利亚以及多哥首次派遣军队，将在几天之内到达北部地区作战。但是组建一支组织严密的军队仍需时日。总之，法国可能还将继续进行干预。奥朗德本人也表示只要有需要，法国将会一直采取行动。</p>

<strong>殷切希望</strong></p>

<p>Reform of the labour-camp system would be welcome, but more change must come soon</p>

<p>劳教制度改革实属欢迎，但必须有更多实质性改革</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Jan 12th 2013 | from the print edition</p>

<p>IN HUNAN province last August, Tang Hui was sentenced to 18 months in a labour camp. Her crime was to demand tougher sentences for the men who had kidnapped and raped her 11-year-old daughter. In days gone by, Ms Tang would simply have disappeared. In the age of the microblog, thousands of incensed middle-class people took up her case. Ms Tang was released, and on January 7th the government announced that the labour-camps system would be reformed (see article).</p>

<p>去年8月，湖南（信访妈妈）唐辉被判处8个月劳教。她的罪名是要求对绑架且强奸她11岁女儿的罪犯处以更重刑法。在过去，像唐辉这样的事件很容易被淡化。但在微博无处不在的时代，数以千计愤世嫉俗的中产阶级在微博上评论她的事件。因此唐女士被提前释放，中国政府在1月7号宣布对劳教制度进行改革。</p>

<p>In Guangzhou last week, allegedly under orders from the provincial propaganda chief, an editorial in Southern Weekend, a reformist newspaper, was altered before publication (seearticle). The original called for greater respect of rights enshrined in China’s constitution. The amended version praised the Communist Party and China’s political system. Some Southern Weekend staff called a strike and supporters protested outside their offices in Guangzhou, chanting political slogans of a sort rarely heard on China’s streets since 1989.</p>

<p>上周，广州省委宣传部长私自命令改动“改革系”报社《南方周末》的一篇社论（即新年贺词）。原文章呼吁尊重中国宪法规定的权利（《中国梦，宪政梦》）。删改版本则赞美共产党和中国政治制度。《南方周报》一些员工为此进行罢工，支持者则在广州的报社总部办公楼外抗议声援，举起了自1989年以来在中国很少看到的政治标语。</p>

<p>In both cases, officials were in breach of China’s constitution. There is nothing new in that. The officials were behaving as officials always have behaved. What has changed is the expectations of the people. Chinese citizens can no longer be pacified with economic growth and slogans. They want political change. How Xi Jinping, China’s new leader, manages this growing pressure for reform will determine his, and his country’s, future.</p>

<p>中国官员在这两起事件中违反了国家宪法，这已不是什么新鲜事了。官员们的处理方法一如既往，而变化的则是老百姓的期待。中国公民不再满足于经济增长这样的口号，他们期待政治改革。中国新任领导人习近平如何处理这种不断上升的改革压力将决定着他和中国的命运。</p>

<p>The justice system and press freedom are core reasons for popular discontent. China’s reform-through-labour system, known as laojiao, was set up in 1957 under Mao Zedong. It is different from the mainstream system of prisons and labour camps whose inmates have been through the judicial system. Established to deal with “counter-revolutionaries”, laojiao camps are now reserved for petty criminals, prostitutes and petitioners who embarrass the government. People can be locked up in them without trial for up to four years. They are said to hold around 160,000 detainees, possibly more.</p>

<p>司法体制和出版自由是民怨的重要原因。中国的劳动改造制度-劳教，于1957由毛泽东建立。它与主要的监狱制度和劳改营（犯人都是通过司法体系判刑）不同。劳改制度建立的初衷是打击反革命派（右派），而现在则针对轻微违法的犯罪人员，嫖妓者以及令政府难堪的请愿者。无需通过审判程序，就可以将这些人最长关押四年之久。据说这样的拘留者已有16万之多，甚至更多。</p>

<p><strong>Hard labour and free speech</strong>
<strong>强迫劳役和言论自由</strong></p>

<p>How serious the plans for reform are remains unclear. The microblog of a senior legal journalist quoted a senior legal official saying that the government would “stop using” thelaojiao system within a year. Hours later, however, Xinhua, the official news agency, reported that the system would be “reformed”, not abolished. Previous promises of reform have come to nothing; and even if detainees are to be allowed a lawyer and a judicial hearing, China’s legal system offers defendants few protections. Even so, many analysts are encouraged.</p>

<p>改革的前景尚不明朗。一位资深的法律新闻记者在微博上引用了一位高级法律官员的话说政府将在一年内停止劳教制度。然而，几个小时之后，官方喉舌新华社报道称劳教制度不是被废除，而是被改良。之前信誓旦旦的改革落得一纸空文；即便是允许劳改拘留人员有律师辩护以及司法听证，中国的法律体系仅对他们提供很少的法律保护。就算如此，许多政治观察者还是很受鼓舞。</p>

<p>Since the early 1990s there has been an implicit deal in China between rulers and ruled—that the rulers would ensure prosperity so long as the ruled did not demand too much freedom. Now many people seem to be reneging on the deal. They’ve got the prosperity, and they want the freedom too. As fast as internet censors delete critical articles and tweets, more angry middle-class people join the debate and start posting new complaints. On January 7th Yao Chen, a famous film star with more than 30m followers on her microblog, quoted Alexander Solzhenitsyn in support of the Southern Weekend journalists: “one word of truth outweighs the whole world.” Even people within the establishment are calling for political change. Last month 72 respected citizens, mostly academics and lawyers, signed a petition calling for radical reform.</p>

<p>自上个世纪90年代初开始，中国官方和民众有一个隐含的“买卖”&mdash;即只要民众不要求过多的自由，官方将会保证社会繁荣。现在似乎许多民众对此“食言”，他们已有繁荣的生活，也需要自由。批评性文章和社交网络已经发现就很快被网络审查制度删除，越来越多对此不满的中产阶级对此参与辩论，不断的刊登新的不满评论。1月7日，著名电影明星姚晨和其3000万微博粉丝引用索尔仁尼琴（俄罗斯）的一句话支持《南方周末》记者：“一句真话能比整个世界的分量还重。”甚至连党内人士也呼吁政治改革。上个月，72位德高望重的公民（大部分是学术者和律师）共同签署了一份提倡根本性改革的请愿书。</p>

<p>For liberal Westerners, ending censorship and labour camps is a moral imperative. For Mr Xi, a pragmatic authoritarian, the calculation is different, but if he knows what is good for him and his country, he will arrive at the same answer. The party’s efforts to maintain control through repression are leading to instability, not stability. Reform is risky, but avoiding it is riskier still.</p>

<p>对于西方的自由主义者，结束审查制度和劳改营是一种道德需要。对于务实派的习来说，想法却不同，但是倘若他知道怎么样才能对他和国家来说有利，他则会给出和前者一样的答案。共产党竭尽全力通过镇压来维持对人们的控制力，结果导致社会的不稳定，而非安定。改革是很冒险，但是不改革仍然是更加冒险的事情。</p>

<p>Mr Xi clearly understands the strength of popular feeling, particularly on the issue of corruption and official extravagance. As he tours the country, he has made much of avoiding the usual elaborate banquets. “Four dishes and a soup” has become the media shorthand for his more frugal, more open approach. But slogans against graft will no longer placate China’s people. Mr Xi needs to start changing the system. One photo posted online in support of the striking journalists showed a dozen men and women holding posters that read: &ldquo;Four dishes and a soup is not real reform. Press freedom is real reform.&rdquo;</p>

<p>习清楚的明白民心所向，特别是关于腐败和官员奢侈浪费的问题。当他在全国范围内视察是，尽量避免以往的奢华宴会。“四菜一汤”已成为媒体对他更为节俭和开放态度的简称。习近平需要着手改革制度。网上流传一张支持罢工记者的照片，很多人举着海报，上面写道：“四菜一汤不是真正的改革，新闻自由才是王道。”</p>

<p>Correction: The original version of this leader wrongly stated that the &ldquo;four dishes and soup&rdquo; slogan was seen on a banner in Guangzhou this week, rather than in a photo posted online. This was corrected on January 11th. We apologise for the error.</p>

<p>纠正：我们之前错误报道习的“四菜一汤”原版本来自本周广州标语，而是网上流传的照片。该错误已于1月11号纠正，我们对此表示歉意。</p>

<strong>军事密友难说再见</strong></p>

<p>As it ponders what kind of force to leave in Afghanistan after 2014, the White House has started talking about a “zero option”</p>

<p>美国政府已掂量在阿富汗“零驻军”</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Jan 12th 2013 | from the print edition</p>

<p>FOR all the smiles and handshakes, this week’s visit to Washington, DC, by Afghanistan’s president, Hamid Karzai, was a tense affair. Mr Karzai was due to meet President Barack Obama on January 11th to discuss the scope and size of America’s military presence in his country after the end of 2014, when almost all of NATO’s combat troops are due to leave.</p>

<p>阿富汗总统卡尔扎伊于这周对美国进行访问，所有微笑和握手也预示着这次紧张的会晤。卡尔扎伊1月11号会见与奥巴马总统 ，就2014年底之后美国在阿富汗驻扎军队的范围和规模展开拉锯战，北约作战部队计划在2014年底从阿富汗撤军。</p>

<p>Mr Karzai may have overplayed his hand. He knows that a bilateral security agreement with America will be vital. Yet the shrillness of some of Mr Karzai’s criticisms of America’s conduct of the war has only played into the hands of those in the administration who would like to be shot of Afghanistan. Nothing is likely to be decided for several months—the agreement does not have to be signed until November—but there is now talk of a so-called zero option, which would see the departure of all American forces next year.</p>

<p>卡尔扎伊总统也许高估了自己的影响力。他知道与美国达成双边安全协议至关重要。然而卡尔扎伊对美国战争行为的强烈谴责正好被想要彻底摆脱阿富汗的美国政府官员所利用。在接下来的几个月，双方不太可能达成一致协议—最早也要到11月份才能决定签署双边协议&mdash;但是双方正在讨论的是所谓“零驻军”，即美军将于明年从阿富汗全部撤军。</p>

<p>Until very recently it had been assumed that America would want to keep at least 20,000 of its troops in Afghanistan, bolstered by a few thousand more from NATO allies. They would be there to continue the training of Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and to provide essential capabilities that the Afghans still lack and have come to depend upon when fighting the Taliban alongside Western forces. These include air transport for logistics and medical evacuation, surveillance and intelligence, and close air support. In addition, America would retain special forces and armed drones to stop al-Qaeda’s leadership regrouping in Pakistan’s tribal areas or returning to the terrorist group’s old training grounds in Afghanistan itself.</p>

<p>最近，外界认为美国想要继续在阿富汗至少驻军2万人，北约盟国也会驻军数千人。他们将继续训练阿富汗国家安全部队以及加强阿富汗锁仍缺乏的重要作战能力，而且与西方军队共同对抗塔利班的时候必须依靠这种作战能力。其中包括航空物流运输，医疗后送，监控与侦查，以及近距空中支援。另外，美国将继续保留特种部队以及武装无人机阻止基地组织在巴基斯坦部落地区进行领导重组或返回在阿富汗本土的恐怖组织老训练场所。</p>

<p>For the Afghans, it seemed self-evident that America would want to keep bases in their country as a way of maintaining its influence in a region full of security threats, whether from Iran or from a failing Pakistani state armed to the teeth with nuclear weapons. They also believed assurances from the Americans and the wider world that they would not be abandoned, and that, after spending so much blood and treasure, the West would not allow Afghanistan to descend into chaos and civil war yet again.</p>

<p>对于阿富汗人来说，美国想继续保持在阿富汗的美军基地，以维持其在充满安全威胁地区（无论是在伊朗而或衰败的巴基斯坦还是充斥着核武器的地区）的影响力，这一点似乎是不言而喻的。他们也相信美国以及国际社会对他们做出的保证，即国际不会对他们置之不顾，而且已花费了大量财力以及丧失了众多作战人员，西方国家绝不会让阿富汗再一次陷入混乱和内战。</p>

<p>Mr Karzai and other Afghan political leaders are sensitive about their country’s sovereignty. But they have no intention of emulating the Iraqis, who brought an abrupt end to the presence of American troops by refusing to sign a new status of forces agreement providing immunity from prosecution for foreign soldiers.</p>

<p>卡尔伊扎和其他阿富汗政治领导人敏感的还是他们国家的主权问题。但是他们不打算效仿伊拉克（伊拉克拒绝签署一项驻美军豁免权的新美军地位协议，从而阻止美军驻军伊拉克）。</p>

<p>Yet they appear to have underestimated how fast the appetite in Mr Obama’s administration has waned for keeping a significant military presence in Afghanistan after 2014. Acute budgetary pressures; the draining of public support for involvement in a war most believe long ago to have been lost; and a belief in some quarters that drones and the intelligence networks that have been built up over the past decade are all that is needed for American security: all have chipped away at the notion of leaving behind a substantial force. On January 8th Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser at the White House, confirmed that leaving no troops behind after 2014 was one of the options under active consideration.</p>

<p>然而，奥巴马政府对2014年之后继续保持在阿富汗大型驻军规模的欲望已减弱，他们似乎低估这一点。 严重的财政压力；大部分人认为长期卷入战争是奥巴马的公众支持率下降；美国一些地区普遍认为无人机和过去几十年来建立的情报网络都应该用于美国安全。1月8日， 美国副国家安全顾问Ben Rhodes证实美国正在积极讨论2014年在阿富汗零驻军的计划。</p>

<p>How much of this should come as a surprise? In the vice-presidential election debate last October, when asked about the drawdown timetable for Afghanistan, Joe Biden said: “We are leaving. We are leaving in 2014. Period.” Since Mr Biden has frequently argued for America having the lightest possible footprint in Afghanistan, his remark got little attention. But in November, when the American commander of the NATO-led international coalition, General John Allen, told his bosses at the Pentagon that he favoured a slow drawdown of combat troops over the next two years and a residual force of at least 15,000 to be provided by America alone, he was told to come back with lower estimates.</p>

<p>这一计划在多大程度上才算得上一个惊喜？在去年10月进行的副总统竞选辩论中，当问及从阿富汗撤军的时间计划时，乔-拜登说：“我们正在撤军，我们将于2014年完全撤军。”拜登不断主张在阿富汗进行少量驻军，很少有人注意他说话的内容。但是到11月，当美国北约领导的国际联军指挥官John Allen将军告诉其在国防部上司，他支持在未来两年作战部队逐渐从阿富汗撤军以及美国继续驻军1万五的军力，他了解到撤军的数目要低于估计的数目</p>

<p>Unfortunately for General Allen, at about the same time he found himself embroiled in the fallout from the sudden resignation of David Petraeus as director of the Central Intelligence Agency. It may have weakened his bargaining position. This month General Allen offered revised proposals for a force ranging from about 3,000 to 9,000. Most military experts, however, still believe that an international force of around 30,000 is needed to support the ANSF after 2014.</p>

<p>这对于Allen将军是不幸的，同时他也发现自己卷入中央情报局局长David Petraeus 突然辞职的余波当中。这也许会削弱他的谈判地位。Allen将军于这个月提交了修订后的提案，建议在阿富汗驻军3000到9000。然而，大部分军事专家坚持认为2014年之后需要3万国际部队支援阿富汗国家安全部队。</p>

<p>Yet it now appears that the troop levels under consideration by the president range between 6,000 and none. His choice of defence secretary, Chuck Hagel, a former Republican senator whom the president nominated this week, is unlikely to challenge those numbers. Mr Hagel has long been a sceptic when it comes to Afghanistan and has talked of “looking for the exit”. Even if the higher force figure gets the go-ahead, allies will be reluctant to contribute to it, concluding that America is more than halfway out of the door and that such a minimal force can achieve little beyond a small training mission in Kabul and securing the air base at nearby Bagram for limited counter-terrorism operations.</p>

<p>然而，美国总统考虑的驻军范围似乎是少于6000。奥巴马这周钦定的新任国防部长Chuck Hagel(前共和党参议员)不太可能去质疑这一数字。当涉及到阿富汗时，Hagel一直都是持怀疑态度以及讨论寻找对策。尽管更高的驻军数目得到批准，北约同盟国不愿增派各自的部队，由此可以看出美国已占一半以上的驻军力量，而且这样的小型驻军力力量除了在喀布尔进行规模小的训练任务和在巴格拉附近保护空军基地而进行有限的反恐行动之外，并不能有多少效果。</p>

<p>Despite an improving combat performance, it is highly uncertain whether the ANSF will cope. Hastily recruited and trained, the ANSF is still a work in progress. It was deliberately denied heavy weapons or much of an air force on the assumption that America would provide key “enablers” for years to come. It now takes the lead security role in about 85% of the country by population, and overall levels of violence are slightly down on previous years. But according to the Pentagon’s latest report on the progress of Afghan forces, only one out of 23 brigades is capable of operating without any outside help. It now looks as if the ANSF will be on its own in southern Afghanistan, where the Taliban is strongest, as well as in the wild east of the country which borders the lair in North Waziristan of the Haqqani network.</p>

<p>虽然阿富汗国家安全部队在作战能力上有了一定的改善，但是该部队是否能够单独作战仍然十分的不确定。经过匆忙的招募和训练，ANSF的作战能力还在不断的加强。假如美国将来向阿富汗提供关键武器，重型武器或空军部队不列入其范围。ANSF现已在全国85%人口地区的安全事务中起着重要作用，暴力事件在这几年来总体水平略有下降。但是根据美国国防部关于阿富汗部队进展的最新报告，在没有外援的情况下，仅有1/23的部队能够单独作战。现在看来ANSF在塔利班势力最强的阿富汗南部地区和与北瓦济里斯坦边境地区哈卡尼激进组织巢穴交界的东部荒野地区靠自己单独作战了。</p>

<p>As well as a security transition, a crucial political transition is also under way, with a presidential election due in 2014 (Mr Karzai is constitutionally barred from standing again). Whether Mr Obama decides on a force of 6,000 or on no troops at all, Afghans going to the polls 16 months from now will be facing much bleaker prospects than many might have expected only a few months ago.</p>

<p>进行安全工作移交工作的同时，一场重要的政权更替也在进行着，2014年阿富汗将进行总统选举（根据该国宪法，卡布扎伊不会再次连任）。关于奥巴马是否决定在阿富汗驻军6000人或是零驻军，在接下来的16个月里，阿富汗民众参与投票将面临比数月之前所期待的还要更为暗淡的前景。</p>

<strong>根源不在他们，而是你们自己</strong></p>

<p>Jan 7th 2013, 20:23 by R.M. | WASHINGTON, DC</p>

<p>ANN LYNN of Scottsdale, Arizona, wrote a letter to the New York Times last week that sums up the thinking of many Americans regarding the country&rsquo;s fiscal outlook.</p>

<p>来自（美国）亚利桑那州的斯科茨代尔城市的ANN LYNN上周向纽约时报写了一封信，信中总结了许多美国人对国家财政前景的想法。</p>

<!--more-->


<p>“However much we raise taxes and/or try to cut spending, we will constantly be thwarted if Washington does nothing about government waste. I would have no objection to paying taxes (within reason) if only I did not know that so much goes right down the drain!”</p>

<p>“如果国家对政府浪费熟视无睹,无论我们再怎么提高税收和（或）努力削减开支，我们也会不断遭受财政危机困扰。要是我不知道这么多开支全部都付之东流，我本来是愿意在合理范围内向政府缴税的。”</p>

<p>My holidays were spent with a political crowd who share Ms Lynn&rsquo;s aversion to &ldquo;government waste&rdquo;, which they would define broadly to include money spent on welfare queens and food-stamp fraudsters, as well as unnecessary government workers and unwanted public services. In fact, they would include most of the stimulative outlays enacted under Barack Obama. This wasteful spending needs to be reined in or America will go the way of Greece, they say.</p>

<p>我的整个假期就是与一群政治人士讨论关于Lynn反感“政府浪费”的问题，他们广泛定义“政府浪费”，其中包括福利皇后（注释1）和冒领食品券行为以及不必要的政府员工开支和公共设施服务。事实上，奥巴马制定的大多数刺激性支出都可以被划入这种所谓的“政府浪费”。他们指出，如果这种浪费性的支出行为不得到控制，美国将重蹈希腊的覆辙。</p>

<p>You can see why many Americans are opposed to raising revenue in an effort to close the budget gap. They don&rsquo;t like the things they believe their money is buying. Fortunately, as the economy recovers, their money is buying less of these things. In fact most of the story behind America&rsquo;s recent string of large deficits is slump-related, a result of lower tax revenues due to the underperforming economy, and increased spending on things like unemployment insurance, food stamps and Medicaid. As the economy recovers, revenues increase and safety-net spending declines, the debt-to-GDP ratio should return to a relatively stable level in the short term.</p>

<p>你可以看出为什么许多的美国人都反对增加财政收入以缩小预算缺口这个计划。他们认为自己正为一些政府支出买单，而对这些支出，他们并不喜欢。值得庆幸的是，随着经济状况的好转，他们的税金花在所谓“政府浪费”上的份额也减少了。事实上，美国最近一系列大规模赤字背后的许多类似情况与经济衰退有关，经济不佳造成税收减少，而对诸如失业保险，食物券和医疗补助的支出却与日俱增。当经济复苏，财政收入增加，社会福利支出减少时，债务占国内生产总值比率在短期内应该恢复到一个相对稳定的水平。</p>

<p>The longer-term fiscal outlook is more bleak, but my holiday crowd does not distinguish between the distinct challenges. They again blame &ldquo;waste&rdquo; and those they call &ldquo;the takers&rdquo;. Some people are hooked on government handouts, they say, echoing a common refrain from last year&rsquo;s election battle. In keeping with the remarkable disconnect between the actual takers and their perception of reality, none of my group acknowledges their own enjoyment of government social programmes.</p>

<p>虽然从长期来看，财政前景惨淡，但是在假期和我一起参与讨论的政党对这些明显挑战的认识却没什么不同。他们将责任归咎于这种“浪费行为“和他们所称的“索求者”。他们认为，有些人依赖政府救济（这一说法在去年美国大选中已司空见惯）。社会福利的真正索取者和他们对现实的认识之间有着显著的偏差，与此相一致的，和我讨论的小组成员中没人意识到自己享受的政府社会福利项目。</p>

<p>Many Americans don&rsquo;t like the things they believe their money is buying. But their bill is hardly reduced by cutting payments to the jobless, dependent moochers they see as the cause of the country&rsquo;s fiscal troubles. Last year the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities ran the numbers and found</p>

<p>他们不喜欢他们所缴税金所买的东西。他们将失业者和吃皇粮的人视为国家财政困难的根源。但减少对这这人的救济支出也很难使他们的税单减少。去年，预算和政策优先中心分析数据发现：</p>

<p>“People who are neither elderly nor disabled — and do not live in a working household — received only 9 percent of [entitlement] benefits. Moreover, the vast bulk of that 9 percent goes for medical care, unemployment insurance benefits (which individuals must have a significant work history to receive), Social Security survivor benefits for the children and spouses of deceased workers, and Social Security benefits for retirees between ages 62 and 64. Seven out of the 9 percentage points go for one of these four purposes.”</p>

<p>“那些既非年老，残疾且非来自工薪家庭的人只享受到9%的国家福利。而且，这9%的福利主要是医疗服务，失业保险（受益者必须有足够的工作经历才能享有）， 在职人士过世后其子女和配偶所获得的社会保障遗眷福利，以及62-64岁退休人员享有的社会保障福利。在这仅有的9%的福利中，7/9只能享有其中一项福利。”</p>

<p>The story is similar when looking at discretionary programmes—if there is a pure &ldquo;entitlement society&rdquo;, it is small and poorly funded.</p>

<p>社会补充福利的情况也类似 - 如果说有一个纯粹的“福利社会”，那么这个社会规模小而且资助缺乏。</p>

<p>There is a reason politicians often do not specify which spending cuts they&rsquo;re talking about in budget negotiations: the popular ones (see cuts to foreign aid) don&rsquo;t add up. And, in general, Americans do like the programmes that primarily drive the country&rsquo;s fiscal imbalances—notably Social Security (20% of the budget) and Medicare (21%, taken with Medicaid and CHIP). Most of us do or will (hopefully) benefit from those programmes. That leaves us with the uncomfortable reality that we, not the jobless moochers, are the problem.</p>

<p>政客们通常没有详细说明预算谈判中所讨论的财政削减的原因：民众都支持削减的项目（如对外援助）数额不足以填补漏洞，总的来说，美国人不喜欢那些作为国家财政失衡主要推手的福利项目。—尤其是社会保障福利（占20%的财政）和医疗服务（占21%，还包括医疗补助与儿童健保项目）。乐观的来说，大部分人能或将要享受这些福利项目。这么一来，我们面对一个令人不安的现实：即我们才是问题的所在，而非那些啃福利的失业者。</p>

<p>Greg Mankiw, an economist and former advisor to Mitt Romney, made clear the challenge facing America in a column two weeks ago: &ldquo;Ultimately, unless we scale back entitlement programs far more than anyone in Washington is now seriously considering, we will have no choice but to increase taxes on a vast majority of Americans.&rdquo; My colleague notes that Jonathan Chait is confident that Americans will choose tax hikes over cuts to their own entitlements. But is that really the calculation most Americans are making? Most are still in denial over their role in America&rsquo;s fiscal drama. And as long as they are able to find convenient scapegoats for the country&rsquo;s fiscal challenges they will oppose the infliction of pain on themselves. Someone needs to tell these people, it&rsquo;s not them, it&rsquo;s you.</p>

<p>两周以前，经济学家兼为罗姆尼前顾问Greg Mankiwa在一专栏明确指出美国面临的挑战：“从长远来看，除非仔细考虑超过以往任何缩减福利项目的计划，否则我们只能对大部分美国民众提高征税。”我同事说Jonathan Chait深信美国人宁愿选择增加赋税而不愿减少他们享有的福利。但是这真的是大部分美国人所考虑的吗？大部分人仍然在不愿意承认他们在这场美国财政闹剧中所扮演的角色。而且只要能够找到国家财政困难的替罪羔羊，他们不会感到痛苦。需要有人告诉这些人，根源不是他们，还是你们自己。</p>
